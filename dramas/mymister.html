            <li>Why I Watched This</li>
            <p>
                Mainly because I tend to watch K-dramas with the same actor/actress as my previous K-drama. Since this has IU (Lee Ji-eun) in it, I decided to watch this K-drama; which I never ever regret doing.

                First Impression
            </li>
            <p>
                This K-drama is HARD. When I said I like K-dramas that are "realistic" in real life, this hits harder than my life so far I believe lmao. I like how this drama shows the "real" side of our world. I definitely love this drama at first sight because how relatable it is to our world nowadays.

            <p>
                Definitely HAVE TO WATCH if you're into the kind of movies that brings out the deep and dark side of our society. The movie is just beautiful in how realistic it is with what's happening in real life. Even though I started watching this because of IU's influence, the plot was what got me going until the last episode. Two words to describe this: <strong>Worth it</strong>.

            My Mister tells the story of an impoverished and debt-laden young woman (IU) struggling to stay afloat as she nurses her deaf, sick grandmother and working a temporary job. She develops an unlikely bond with one of her equally miserable supervisors (Lee Sun-kyun), which is subjected to scrutiny and manipulation by their colleagues, friends, and dysfunctional families. Enduring the weight of their respective lives, they come together, forming new relationships, keeping parts of themselves secret — but ultimately healing one another's past scars.
