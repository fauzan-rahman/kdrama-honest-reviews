            <li>Why I Watched This</li>
            <p>
                I've never watched K-drama before, so Hotel Del Luna was my first K-drama. Having nothing to do during the third week of pandemic was part of the reason why I came to this K-drama. I didn't come up with this drama on my own, I asked one of my close friend who have watched tons of K-drama for years. I asked for her favorite K-drama and Hotel Del Luna it is.

                Honestly, I didn't have high hopes with K-drama and I thought all K-dramas are boring (no offense lol). The truth is I wasn't wrong, though I wasn't fully right as well since there were some K-dramas that got me crying in bed for days. Karma does hit you fast, doesn't it? At the end of the day, Jang Man-Wol (the main female character) was the one that made me play the second episode because she got that "attitude" in my opinion and that's what makes it interesting.

            <p>
                This K-drama is a light drama and I totally recommend you to watch, moreover if you guys like handsome/pretty main characters lmao. They will have some ghosts that (I think) might be scary for some people. Since this is a rom-com drama, there's a love story involved and its love-life is also the comedy within the story. The plot is decent, but the romance and the comedy within its love story was something that got me watching until the end.

                Notes: A bit bias since this was my first K-drama so this has some sentimental value for me.

        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            "Hotel del Luna" (previously known as "Guest House of the Moon") is not like any other hotel. A supernatural place, the hotel is not visible in its true form during the daytime and humans can only come across the hotel under special circumstances. Its staff and clients are all ghosts coming to terms with unfinished business in their former lives before they pass on to the afterlife and cycle of reincarnation;[6] the staff, in particular, have been there for decades or centuries as they have not settled their grudges. The exception to this is the hotel's general manager, which has been filled by a succession of human "passersby" since they need to interact normally with the real world in certain instances, like paying bills or fulfilling ghosts' requests with still-living relatives/friends.

            Jang Man-wol (Lee Ji-eun) is the owner of this hotel, which is located in Myeong-dong, Seoul. Due to a huge sin committed more than a millennium ago, the hotel catering to the dead has been bound to her soul. As a result of manipulation by the deity Mago (Seo Yi-sook), Jang Man-wol meets Gu Chan-sung's father (Oh Ji-ho) and makes a deal: in exchange for his life, his son will work for her 20 years later.

        <p>
            Desperate to save his son, the father takes Gu Chan-sung (Yeo Jin-goo) abroad. The young man grows up to be a sincere, level-headed perfectionist with a soft heart. He comes back to South Korea after his father's death, 21 years later to be an assistant manager at a multi-national hotel corporation, only to face Jang Man-wol, after which he ends up fulfilling the agreement and becomes the manager of Hotel del Luna. Through Gu Chan-sung, the mysteries and the secrets behind the hotel and its owner are revealed.
