        <h2>My Thoughts on This</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Why I Watched This</li>
            <p>
                Actually, I think this was my real FIRST K-drama but I wasn't aware that watching this counts as diving into the K-drama world at that time. I believe this K-drama came out during the week that Covid-19 was anounced and it went viral in my home country (Indonesia) and I decided to watch this because the story seems "realistic" and can happen in real life.

            <p>
                I like a movie/series that is "realistic" in a way that it may happen in the real world. As expected, this K-drama was fire, I mean, FIRE!!!! I cried on the first episode, and crying is a good thing in K-drama world so I went to watch the whole series lmao.

            <p>
                If it wasn't for this K-drama, I would've never tasted how it feels like to cry because of a movie scene. No better words to describe this K-drama other than a big W.
